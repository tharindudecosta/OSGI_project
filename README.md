# PC-store-OSGI

This report describes how the OSGi (Open Service Gateway Initiative) technology was used to construct a producer-consumer scenario.
The basic tenet is that a service must be created/published by the producer, consumed by the consumer, and subscribed to by the consumer.
The producer-consumer scenario is covered in numerous sections of this essay, from developing it through putting it into practice.
We created the solution using an OSGI Framework application created using the microkernel architecture to showcase a ‘PC Shop’ scenario.
